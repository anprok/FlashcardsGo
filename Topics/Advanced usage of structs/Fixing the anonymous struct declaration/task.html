<p>Mrs. Puff is learning about structs in Go. She tried to implement an anonymous struct to quickly save the scores of her students after grading their exams. However, she forgot to initialize it with a struct literal and now her program isn't working!</p>
<p>Can you help Mrs. Puff fix her anonymous struct and initialize it properly with the following values: <code class="java">SpongeBob</code> as the student name and <code class="java">0</code> as the score?</p>
<p>To solve this task, you don't need to write or modify any code within the <code class="java">main</code> function. The objective of this task is to initialize the <code class="java">grades</code> struct with the previously mentioned values.</p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
