<h2>Using the JSON-to-Go struct converter</h2>
<p>Emma is working with the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CoinDesk</a><a href="https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> JSON API</a>. Before writing any code she wants to know what the JSON object returned by CoinDesk would look like, converted into its Go <code class="java">struct</code> representation.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Here you can <strong><a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/698590/coindesk.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">download an extract of part of the CoinDesk JSON response for Bitcoin prices in USD</a></strong> that Emma is currently working with.</div><p></p>

<p>Your task is to help Emma use the <a href="https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JSON-to-Go struct</a> tool to convert the <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/698590/coindesk.json" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">extract of the JSON response</a> returned by CoinDesk, and then simply copy and paste its actual Go <code class="java">struct</code> type representation to the textbox below:</p>
